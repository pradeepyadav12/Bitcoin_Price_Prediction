# Overview
The article outlines a step-by-step process to build a predictive model for Bitcoin prices. It emphasizes the importance of using historical price data and technical indicators to train the model effectively. The approach involves data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

# Objectives
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather historical Bitcoin price data and preprocess it to handle missing values, normalize features, and create relevant technical indicators.

2. Feature Engineering: Develop features such as Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to capture essential market trends.

3. Model Development: Utilize machine learning algorithms, specifically the XGBoost regressor, to build a model that can predict future Bitcoin prices based on the engineered features.

4. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability in predicting Bitcoin prices.
